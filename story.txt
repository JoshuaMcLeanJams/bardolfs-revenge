FALBORD: HEIR TO THE CURSE

Seven years have passed since you slew the dark wizard Bardolf and saved King
?? from his accursed castle.

He has built a new castle, larger and grander, some distance from the cursed
land. You have since become a master gaea, an earth mage, fascinated by the
powers Bardolf possessed but unwilling to give in to the darkness.

Now a new foe, FALBORD, has arrived, threatening to spread evil to this new
land. Stop him at all costs!
