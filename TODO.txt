- update JMTools #if BARDOLF


long term
- update input manager to use InputType enum: Held, Down, Up instead of
  separate functions

start: -5
Bardolf FInal: 88.5

BUGS
- main weapon has no time limitation? should act exactly like normal cards

BIGGEST TO DO THING - PUT THESE ALL IN BITBUCKET'S ISSUE TRACKER!  
TUTORIAL
* show which buttons are being used (test if controller or keyboard before entering)
* explain spell selection: 
        - deck
        - spell bag
        - where spells come from
        - how they're selected
        - what happens after they're used 

GAME ADDITIONS
- "synergize" button to combine matching spells of different elements
        - uses a turn but creates stronger synergized spell
        - synergized spells can match with spells matching either element
- can select multiple spells with matching elements
        - but what about synergy elements? i.e. water + earth/air
* animate misses to make them more obvious
* "no" sound for selecting invalid option
* gray out invalid options in battle card select
* receive spells based on enemy type (from selection of enemy-related spells)
        - potential for healing instead, higher chance if HP is lower
* slight delay after spell select in battle
* determine distinction between safe and unsafe (combat) areas
* randomize time between AI movements and attacks
* battle card: target specific row/column/cell
* battle card: target cell based on enemy position
* battle card: auto-target enemy
* battle card: damage based on distance to target
* save/load
* healing cards (Spirit element)

CONTENT
* bonk SFX in battle/field
* different battle music for Bardolf
* Bardolf's lair music: creepy (current tune is more town/castle)
* title screen+music
* different hit sound for player/enemy
* sound for opening treasure
* victory chime

TECH ADDITIONS
* render delays for menus to simulate game boy feel
* allow user to set magnification relative to GB resolution
* start to pause in battle (already done?)
* cell owner change should be "self" or "other" not Player/Enemy
* return to title after game over (or restart game)
* map with enemy list for current region (actual Map for MapManager)
* allow hold up/down for menu
* built-in scroll up/down in MenuCursor/DeckMenu? (instead of events)
* allow battle card multi editing
* JMTools Game Properties: get names of scenes from dragged-in scene objects
* JMTools Game Properties: button to automatically populate scene list
* JMTools Game Properties: bool for whether to copy readme (and name?)

OPTIMIZATION
* store a_user as m_user in BattleCard to save process time
