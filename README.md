# Bardolf's Revenge 0.0.3
(c)2018 [Joshua McLean](http://mrjoshuamclean.com)

**This is an in-progress version. Some features may be undocumented, incomplete, or buggy.**

A Game-Boy-style hybrid of Mega Man Battle Network and Final Fantasy Legend II.

A sequel to the text adventure [Bardolf's Curse](https://joshua-mclean.itch.io/bardolfs-curse) which is also still under development.


## Known Issues

- In the overworld, wait for movement to finish before opening the menu; otherwise, a battle might start and all Hell breaks loose!
- The damage noise is awful and if it plays enough it'll stop, like it knows that it's annoying
- The knights aren't supposed to get into the same cell but sometimes they defy all logic and do anyway

### Battle

Battle starts with a Spell selection menu. Choose up to five spells, but they must match in type (name) to take multiple into battle.

During battle, you can use your main weapon as much as you want but Spells are much more powerful! Keep an eye on the top of the screen to know when you can get more spells.
